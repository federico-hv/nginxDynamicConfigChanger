*
*   What does this piece of code do?
*
* - When the project is run(can be run as cron but would be better to run it after a high networking 	 *   traffic event with some unix tool) the healthy app instances ips are put into the Nginx config file
*	and the file is realoaded having a fresh ip list of instances to route traffic to(loadbalancing).
*
*
*	How?
*
* - Get the healthy instances
* - Get the app instances from the healthy ones using the imageId of the AMI
* - Try to read the local ips file(text file that will keep all the app instances available), if it 
*	doesn't exist it is created.
* - Once read, the aws api is called and the local ips are compared with the ones obtained from the api
*	call.
* - If the ip arrays are different, the nginx.conf file is updated and the nginx service is restarted
* 
*
* -> For this to work the instances must have the same image id, so delete the original app instance and 
*    create completely new instances from the app AMI to correctly route the traffic to all app tier 
*	 instances.
*
*
*
*	USE YOUR OWN CREDENTIALS AND IMAGEID(app instance)!!!!!!!
